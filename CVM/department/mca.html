      <h3>Master of Computer Applications Program Details</h3>
      <p>
     The MCA (Master of Computer Applications) program often allows for some discretion in course selection, especially in the latter part of the program. While the core curriculum provides a strong foundation in computer science principles and practical skills, students may have opportunities to specialize or choose electives based on their interests.
